## Building

To build, open the project (`VSMModel.sln` file) in Visual Studio 2022 and select "Build."

## Testing

Add the `VSMModel.dll` file from the Debug folder to the Labcenter Models directory, then test it using the "Bascule RS.pdsprj" Proteus project.

Note: 
-To create another VSM model, you can simply modify the DsimModel.h and DsimModel.cpp files to be consistent with your project.
